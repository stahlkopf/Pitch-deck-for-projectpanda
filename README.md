# Pitch-deck-for-projectpanda
This was a pitch slide deck for an MVP / prototype I put together and pitched to several investors in a room of 200 people. #2 second place 

Itâ€™s designed to also be humorous and get the crowd laughing but also present a real serious problem and solution 

Project Panda was an idea to measure company happiness of its employees related to their job and allow anonymous feedback every routine day so that management could understand the overall morale of its employees.

Is valuable to capture as companies can often seem surprised by massive loss of talent when it has been quite evident to a worker and coworkers. Yet there was no way for employees to express this in a way they felt safe and non judgemental. 

I believe the anonymous part is very important as employees may not feel comfortable giving accurate feedback if it could be used against them.

Not so much for tracking singular employee happiness but designed to aggregate the company as a whole so that its easy to see via reports/graphs when it started changing and with employee feedback as an option it allows to see possible similarity in reasoning.
